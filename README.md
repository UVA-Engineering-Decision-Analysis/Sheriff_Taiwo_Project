# Probability of Matriculation and Optimal Financial Aid Allocation
A decision tool to aid college recuirters tailor their admission efforts to student profiles best suited to their school or likely to matriculate whilst offering offering an optimal financial aid package.

### Description
Rising awareness of student debt and college affordability are currently at the forefront of many incoming college students and their parents. To combat out of control costs, public and private institutions are looking towards data driven methods to streamline marketing costs, create tuition pricing strategies to compete for students, drive enrollment, and increase revenue. 

### The Decision Problem
* Who is the decision-maker?
    * The decision maker(s) are college recruiters, and financial appropriation teams.
     
* What decision does this agent confront?
    * College Recuriters and Financial Aid Appropriation Committee:
        * College recruiters want to spend their time on  effort on marketing to admitted candidates that will likely matriculate while financial teams want to offer the optimal amount of financial aid required to keep admitted candidates with high likelihood of matriculation and nudge students with mid to low probabilities regions into matriculating. 
        
* What is the set of options from which this decision-maker chooses? 
    * College Recuriters and Financial Aid Appropriation Committee
        * This tool will help decision makers cut costs by using effective target marketing and only offer the optimal amount of financial aid dollars to students with high likelihood of matriculation. Using two years of student data, classification models will be developed for first time incoming student (first time incoming student refers to student that have never been admitted to a four-year college).
        
        
* What are the relevant payoffs of the decision process? 
    * College Admission Committee 
        * limited financial funds
          * Cost of offering financial aid to students who won't matriculate Vs. not offering enough financial aid to students who do not matriculate as a result.
      
            
### The Predictive Tool
* The predictive tool will help college recruiters streamline their marketing efforts towards students with High Likelihood of Matriculation by assigning a probability to matriculate to each admitted student. The optimization portion of this tool aims to achieve two things; use probability results from the classification models to identify and market to students with high likelihood of matriculation and offer optimal financial aid designed for student at different probability ranges.
